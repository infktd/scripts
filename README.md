## Personal Scripts Repository

This repository contains scripts I've created to make my day-to-day work as a cybersecurity engineer and developer smoother and more efficient. Each script is designed to automate, simplify, or enhance common tasks I encounter in my professional and personal projects.

### Script Overviews

- **ssh-private-keygen**: A Python script that interactively generates secure SSH key pairs (ED25519 and optionally RSA), handling file paths, permissions, and user prompts for easy key management across platforms.

More scripts will be added as I continue to build tools for my workflow.

Feel free to explore, use, and modify these scripts. I hope they help others as much as they've helped me!
